# Traveling Salesman Problem using Greedy Algorithm

This repository contains a project that implements the Greedy Algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic NP-hard optimization problem that involves finding the shortest route for a salesperson to visit a set of cities and return to the starting point.
